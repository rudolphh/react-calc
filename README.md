# React Calculator - Yep, a calculator using React

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/rudolphh/react-calc)

### Tech
React Calc uses, you guessed it, an open source library : 
* [React] - a JavaScript library for building user interfaces

And of course React Calc itself is open source with a [public repository][ru-react-calc]
 on GitHub.

### Installation

Download the zip or clone repository.  Once extracted (zip), open index.html in any browser.
